                expensive woman who wears a white mink coat and orders $4OO

                Salt Lake Trick Bike Rider Now Heading
                Three Team Combination 
            </p>
            <p>
                Bud Grey, the Salt Lake boy who has has
                made a name for himself as a trick
                rider arrived in the city yesterday after 
                a years absence on the Pacific coast.
                Grey is now at the head of a three-team 
                combination doing fancy stunts and tricks 
                on a bicycle.  With him are Fravilo Fravlo, the
                girl who looped the loop in a ball at the 
                Salt Palace a couple of seasons ago and Zarrow,
                a comedian trick rider.
            </p>

                Grey is well known locally and is one
                of the few trick riders who has performed
                at the saucer track. He first began trick t
                riding in this city about five years ago 
                and is now at the top of his profession.
                Grey was around visiting friends yesterday
                and is now making arrangements to 
                put his turn on in Salt Lake. From here 
                he goes east, where he is booked ahead
                for the summer season.

                FARISH STREET SATURDAY
                <br>
                NIGHT: Christmas time is here again. And what a really great
                pleasure tis for me to say ... A MERRY, MERRY CHRISTMAS
                TO EVERYBODY, and in saying it we acknowledge our gratitude
                first to the ALMIGHTY, and then to all those whose good wishes,
                backing, favors and support it has been ours to have down through
                the closing year ... We say it with the same depth and fervor to
                all those to whom it has been our opportunity to render a service,
                who we have given our backing, favors, and support during the 
                closing year ... to the rich, the poor,
                the black, the white, the learned and the un-leamed, to everybody
                who has been with us during the year ... UP AND DOWN FAR
                ISH STREET ... To all and every body, here, there, and everywhere,
                in the mellow movements of my Fish and Beer, in the language
                and meaning of Rudyard Kipling, I wish to say: Call a truce, that,
                to our labors let us feast with friends and neighbors, and be mer
                ry as the custom of our caste; For if "faint and forced the
                laughter," and if sadness follow after, We are richer by one mocking
                Christmas past. Again, and again, and again, A Merry, Merry Christmas to every body.
