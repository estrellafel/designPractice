                <h2>Brewmaster Retirement</h2>
                <p>By Odin Gadbout</p>

            <p>
                It is with mixed emotions that we announce the retirement of our ancient and beloved founder, Alton Alebottom.
                While space will not allow us to explicate each of Alton's multitudinous achievements throughout his career at 
                Third Eye Brewery, we here mention only several.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon establishing Third Eye Alchemy some 213 years ago, Alton invented the <dfn>demoxifier</dfn>, an enchanted contraption
                to extract undesirable effusions from the fermenting chambers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several years later, near the end of a late-night work party, Alton purchased a round of ale for all remaining 
                revelers shouting <q>All for ale and ale for all!</q> This quip was later adopted as Third Eye Alchemy's motto.
            </p>
            <aside>
                Alton was also a patron of the arts.

                Alton was also a patron of the arts, supporting fabulous artistic works of all kinds. Just three years ago, Alton 
                donated the famous Hatchling Baby sculpture to Felidon. Also, at great personal expense, he commissioned the creation 
                of the operatic aria Sobbing Blues, sung by the Merfolk choir at the sculptures unveiling ceremony.

                <h2>Felidon's Top 5 Tavern Songs Countdown</h2>
                <p>By Kemal "Cacee" Kasem</p> 
            </header>
            <p>
                At the top of this weeks most popular tavern songs we find the following mega-hits
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Last Call for All</li>
                <li>Spilled Ale Blues</li>
                <li>One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Ale</li>
                <li>Wine and Roses</li>
                <li>Bar Room Bard</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                It seems like everyone you pass in the streets is humming the catchy chorus of Last Call for All. For those who may be 
                new to Felidon and be unaware, we close with the lyrics of this hard-to-forget dactylic hexameter.
            </p>

                Cows
                and some monks
                and some dogs
                and some punks
                drink ale
